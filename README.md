# ChatGPT api

* It uses playwright and chromium to open browser and parse html.
* It is an unoffical api for development purpose only.


# How to install

* Make sure that python and virtual environment is installed.

* Create a new virtual environment

```python
# one time
virtualenv -p $(which python3) pyenv

# everytime you want to run the server
source pyenv/bin/activate
```

* Now install the requirements

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* If you are installing playwright for the first time, it will ask you to run this command for one time only.

```
playwright install
```

* Now run the server

```
python server.py
```

* The server runs at port `5001`. If you want to change, you can change it in server.py
